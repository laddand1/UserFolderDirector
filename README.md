# UserFolderDirector
I made this as an attempt to work around an issue we were having where some of our techs couldn't access their user folders because their user profiles were buried inside of a protected pathway.  In the end we chose a different route but I was left with this snippet.  

Should support Python 2.0 - 3.x (works as of 3.7)

While this code is pretty narrow and it's origin is for a very mundane task, it can be altered for better purposes if I need it to be in the future.
